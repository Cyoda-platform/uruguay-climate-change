# üõ°Ô∏è AI Ethics & Responsible Use Statement

## Our Commitment

The Uruguay Climate Change Monitoring & AI Analysis System is built on principles of **ethical AI development, transparency, fairness, and environmental responsibility**. This document outlines our commitment to responsible AI practices.

---

## üéØ Core Ethical Principles

### 1. Transparency

**What we do:**
- ‚úÖ All AI model architectures are documented and open-source
- ‚úÖ Data sources are clearly cited and attributed
- ‚úÖ Model predictions include confidence scores and uncertainty estimates
- ‚úÖ Decision-making processes are explainable

**How we achieve it:**
- Full documentation of model training processes (see [ML_MODELS.md](ML_MODELS.md))
- Open access to training data (World Bank public datasets)
- Clear API responses showing model confidence and reasoning
- Gemini AI responses include explanations for recommendations

**Example:**
```json
{
  "prediction": 22.5,
  "confidence": 0.87,
  "model": "LSTM",
  "explanation": "Based on 60-day historical pattern showing warming trend"
}
```

### 2. Data Privacy & Security

**What we do:**
- ‚úÖ No collection of personally identifiable information (PII)
- ‚úÖ Only public, aggregated climate data is used
- ‚úÖ No user tracking or behavioral profiling
- ‚úÖ Secure handling of API keys and credentials

**Data sources:**
- **World Bank Climate Data**: Public domain, open license (CC BY 4.0)
- **No personal data**: Country-level aggregates only
- **No proprietary data**: All sources are publicly accessible

**User privacy:**
- No cookies for tracking (only essential session management)
- No analytics without user consent
- No sale or sharing of user queries/data
- Anonymous API usage (no identity required)

---

### 3. Fairness & Non-Discrimination

**What we do:**
- ‚úÖ Models trained on objective climate measurements
- ‚úÖ No demographic or socioeconomic biases in data
- ‚úÖ Equal access to all users regardless of background
- ‚úÖ Open-source and free for public benefit

**Potential biases addressed:**
- **Geographic bias**: Currently focused on Uruguay only (clearly stated)
  - *Future plan*: Expand to other Latin American countries
- **Temporal bias**: Historical data goes back to 1960, but quality improves over time
  - *Mitigation*: Quality control metrics documented in [DATASET.md](DATASET.md)
- **Measurement bias**: Older data may use different methodologies
  - *Mitigation*: Cross-validation with multiple data sources

**Accessibility:**
- Free and open-source (MIT License)
- No paywalls or subscription requirements
- Available in multiple languages (future enhancement)
- Designed for low-bandwidth environments

---

### 4. Accuracy & Reliability

**What we do:**
- ‚úÖ Rigorous model evaluation with cross-validation
- ‚úÖ Performance metrics clearly reported
- ‚úÖ Limitations and uncertainties disclosed
- ‚úÖ Regular model retraining with new data

**Quality assurance:**
- LSTM predictions: MAE < 1.2¬∞C, tested on 20% holdout set
- Prophet seasonality: MAPE < 8%, validated against historical patterns
- Anomaly detection: 95%+ precision, minimizing false alarms
- Gemini AI: Responses reviewed for accuracy and relevance

**Limitations we acknowledge:**
1. **Temporal limitation**: Predictions degrade beyond 30 days
2. **Spatial limitation**: Country-level data may not reflect regional variations
3. **Model uncertainty**: No model is 100% accurate; confidence scores provided
4. **Data lag**: Latest data is from 2021 (4-year delay from World Bank)

**What we don't claim:**
- ‚ùå We do not provide medical or health advice
- ‚ùå We do not predict specific extreme weather events (hurricanes, floods)
- ‚ùå We do not replace professional meteorological services
- ‚ùå We do not guarantee 100% accuracy in predictions

---

### 5. Accountability & Governance

**What we do:**
- ‚úÖ Clear attribution of all data sources
- ‚úÖ Version control for models and code
- ‚úÖ Issue tracking and bug reporting (GitHub)
- ‚úÖ Responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities

**Responsible parties:**
- **Development team**: Maintains code, models, documentation
- **Data providers**: World Bank (data quality and updates)
- **AI providers**: Google (Gemini API), Cyoda (MCP platform)
- **Community**: Open-source contributors and users

**Incident response:**
- Security vulnerabilities: Report to security@[your-domain].com
- Data issues: File issue on GitHub with details
- Ethical concerns: Contact ethics@[your-domain].com
- General support: GitHub Discussions or Issues

**Version control:**
- All models versioned (e.g., `lstm_temperature_v1.0.0.keras`)
- Training data checksums recorded
- Code commits traceable via Git history
- Changelogs maintained for major updates

---

### 6. Environmental Responsibility

**What we do:**
- ‚úÖ Optimize models for energy efficiency
- ‚úÖ Use cloud infrastructure powered by renewable energy
- ‚úÖ Minimize computational waste through efficient architectures
- ‚úÖ Promote climate awareness and action

**Carbon footprint considerations:**

**Training phase:**
- LSTM training: ~0.5 kWh (estimated 0.2 kg CO2e with renewable energy)
- Prophet training: ~0.1 kWh
- Anomaly detection: ~0.05 kWh
- Classifier training: ~0.1 kWh
- **Total training**: ~0.75 kWh (~0.3 kg CO2e)

**Inference phase:**
- LSTM prediction: ~0.001 kWh per request
- Gemini API call: Carbon cost handled by Google (renewable powered)
- Daily operations: Minimal energy usage

**Optimization strategies:**
- Model quantization for reduced size
- Efficient batch processing
- Caching frequently requested predictions
- CPU-optimized inference (no GPU required for production)

**Hosting:**
- Deployed on Cyoda cloud (EU region)
- Cyoda infrastructure targets carbon neutrality
- Docker containers minimize resource overhead

## üö® Potential Risks & Mitigation

### Risk 1: Misinterpretation of Predictions

**Risk:** Users may treat predictions as certainties rather than probabilities.

**Mitigation:**
- Always display confidence scores
- Include disclaimers in UI ("Predictions are estimates, not guarantees")
- Provide explanation of model limitations in documentation
- Link to professional meteorological services for critical decisions

### Risk 2: Over-Reliance on AI Recommendations

**Risk:** Users may follow AI recommendations without consulting experts.

**Mitigation:**
- Label AI insights as "advisory" not "prescriptive"
- Recommend consulting agricultural/emergency professionals
- Provide sources for AI claims (e.g., "Based on historical data from...")
- Include human oversight in critical alert workflows (Cyoda MCP)

### Risk 3: Model Drift & Degradation

**Risk:** Climate patterns change, making historical models less accurate.

**Mitigation:**
- Schedule quarterly model retraining with latest data
- Monitor prediction accuracy on live data
- Alert admins when performance degrades below thresholds
- Version models and allow rollback if needed

### Risk 4: Bias in AI-Generated Insights (Gemini)

**Risk:** Large language models can produce biased or inaccurate text.

**Mitigation:**
- Use structured prompts with factual data inputs
- Cross-check Gemini outputs with statistical model results
- Provide sources and confidence scores
- Allow users to report inappropriate/inaccurate responses
- Regularly review and improve prompt engineering

### Risk 5: Security & API Key Exposure

**Risk:** API keys could be compromised, leading to abuse.

**Mitigation:**
- Environment variables for sensitive data (not in code)
- Rate limiting on all API endpoints
- Regular security audits
- Secrets management with Docker/Kubernetes secrets
- Key rotation policies
